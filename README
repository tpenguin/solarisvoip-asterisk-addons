README for Asterisk Addons
==========================


THESE are modified for use on Solaris Platforms 

Requires:  CSWmysql5devel, CSWmysql5client
(Note:  for version 4 support of MySQL use CSWmysql4devel, CSWmysql4client)

This package contains additional modules for Asterisk which are, for one reason 
or another, not included in the normal base distribution.  Many of these
modules are experimental.

Notes: 

res_config_mysql and cdr_mysql are fully functional:

All others are pre-alpha

1) Using res_config_mysql at the same time as res_config_odbc can create
system instability on some systems.  Please load only one or the other.

TO MAKE:

gmake
gmake pkg
cd SunOS-5.x.x
pkgadd -d SVasterisk-addons-arch-5.x.pkg

Be sure to properly configure your settigns in cdr_mysql.conf and res_mysql.conf



If you encounter errors during compile in asterisk/frame.h (u_int_# no declaration) you should really adjust
asterisk/includes/asterisk/frame.h
u_int#_t    to uint#_t ------- for C clarity
This can be done by also by utilizing the solaris-compat includes, but for best C form and clarity,  this should be changed in frame.h( and many other places) and asterisk recompiled.
